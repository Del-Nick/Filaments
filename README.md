Measurement of the angular divergence (angular characteristics) of terahertz radiation generated by laser filamentation using several narrow-frequency filters (0.1 THz, 0.3 THz, 0.5 THz). Comparisons were made at different filament lengths, changing the focal length of the lens, as well as the number of plasma channels: single and multiple filaments. The measurements were carried out using a bolometer, and also filtered due to parallel measurements of the mode (intensity) from the camera in relative units (in parrots). These units of measurement were converted to mJ by calibration.
